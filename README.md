# SuperCoolClient
isn't the final name

attempt at creating a bsky client that looks like a mix of like twitter/tumblr and the internet in 2012 in general

the looks aren't very original and the code sucks because i'm lazy and not a programmer, sorry

not really very serious in any way so don't expect much!!

it uses atcute !! https://github.com/mary-ext/atcute
